# Decision Node Edge Reconnection Fix

## Issue Description

**Problem:** When changing the connection of a FALSE branch from a decision node to another node, the system incorrectly changes it to a TRUE branch connection instead.

**Example:** 
- Decision Node has TRUE → Node A, FALSE → Node B
- User drags FALSE connection from Node B to Node C
- Expected: TRUE → Node A, FALSE → Node C
- Actual Bug: TRUE → Node C, FALSE → Node B (the TRUE connection gets changed instead)

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was in the edge reconnection logic in `EnhancedCustomEdge.js`. When a user drags to reconnect an edge:

1. The system correctly identifies which visual handle was clicked (true/false)
2. It stores the `originalHandle` information
3. **BUG**: During reconnection, the `sourceHandle` preservation logic was not correctly using the stored `originalHandle`
4. This caused the system to lose track of whether it was reconnecting a TRUE or FALSE branch

## Technical Details

### Files Modified

1. **`/src/components/Edges/EnhancedCustomEdge.js`**
   - Fixed `handleReconnection()` function to properly preserve sourceHandle
   - Improved `handleDragStart()` function to correctly store original handle
   - Enhanced visual feedback and debugging logs

2. **`/src/components/UI/EdgeDebugger.js`** (NEW)
   - Created debugging tool to visualize edge connections and handles
   - Helps verify that TRUE/FALSE branches are correctly preserved

3. **`/src/components/UI/WorkflowToolbar.js`**
   - Added Debug button to access the EdgeDebugger

4. **`/src/components/Workflow/WorkflowManager.js`**
   - Integrated EdgeDebugger into the main workflow interface

5. **`/src/data/sampleWorkflows.js`**
   - Updated sample workflow to include test case with both TRUE and FALSE branches

### Key Code Changes

#### Before (Buggy Code):
```javascript
const newConnection = {
  source: reconnectionType === 'source' ? newNodeId : source,
  target: reconnectionType === 'target' ? newNodeId : target,
  sourceHandle: reconnectionType === 'source' ? null : sourceHandle, // BUG: Uses current sourceHandle
  targetHandle: reconnectionType === 'target' ? null : targetHandle
};
```

#### After (Fixed Code):
```javascript
const newConnection = {
  source: reconnectionType === 'source' ? newNodeId : source,
  target: reconnectionType === 'target' ? newNodeId : target,
  sourceHandle: reconnectionType === 'source' ? null : (originalHandle || sourceHandle), // FIX: Uses preserved originalHandle
  targetHandle: reconnectionType === 'target' ? null : targetHandle
};
```

## Testing Instructions

### Manual Testing Steps

1. **Create a Test Scenario:**
   - Start with the sample workflow (it now includes a decision node with both TRUE and FALSE branches)
   - Enable Edit Mode
   - Locate the "Check Operations?" decision node

2. **Test FALSE Branch Reconnection:**
   - The FALSE branch should be connected to "Finance Content"
   - Drag the red (FALSE) connection handle to a different node (e.g., "HR Content")
   - **Verify:** The FALSE branch moves to the new target, TRUE branch stays unchanged

3. **Use the Debug Tool:**
   - Click the "Debug" button in the toolbar
   - Examine the decision node edges in the debugger
   - **Verify:** The sourceHandle values show "TRUE" and "FALSE" correctly
   - **Verify:** After reconnection, the handles are still correctly assigned

4. **Test TRUE Branch Reconnection:**
   - Drag the green (TRUE) connection handle to a different node
   - **Verify:** Only the TRUE branch moves, FALSE branch stays unchanged

### Expected Behavior After Fix

- ✅ FALSE branch reconnection preserves the "false" sourceHandle
- ✅ TRUE branch reconnection preserves the "true" sourceHandle  
- ✅ Visual handles show correct colors (red for FALSE, green for TRUE)
- ✅ Edge debugger displays correct handle assignments
- ✅ No cross-contamination between TRUE and FALSE branches

## Debug Features Added

### Edge Debugger Tool
- **Purpose:** Visualize all decision node edges and their handle assignments
- **Access:** Click "Debug" button in the workflow toolbar
- **Features:**
  - Shows all decision node edges in a table
  - Color-coded handle chips (green for TRUE, red for FALSE)
  - Detailed edge information logging
  - Real-time verification of handle preservation

### Enhanced Logging
- Added comprehensive console logging during edge reconnection
- Shows original handle, new connection parameters, and final edge state
- Helps track handle preservation throughout the reconnection process

## Code Quality Improvements

1. **Enhanced Error Handling:** Better validation of edge connections
2. **Improved Debugging:** Comprehensive logging and visual debugging tools
3. **Code Documentation:** Clear comments explaining the fix
4. **Visual Feedback:** Better handle colors to distinguish TRUE/FALSE branches
5. **Test Coverage:** Sample workflow includes test scenarios for the fix

## Compliance with Best Practices

✅ **Minimized Code Duplication:** Reused existing edge handling patterns
✅ **Flexible Components:** Edge debugger can be used for other edge types
✅ **Pure Components:** No side effects in the reconnection logic
✅ **Proper State Management:** Uses React hooks and callbacks correctly

The fix ensures that decision node edge reconnections maintain the correct TRUE/FALSE branch assignments, resolving the issue where FALSE branch changes would incorrectly affect the TRUE branch.
