# âœ… PLUS SIGN FEATURE IMPLEMENTED - ADD NODES BETWEEN EXISTING NODES

## ðŸŽ¯ **What You Asked For**
> "We need ability to add node between two existing node. Give a PLUS sign between nodes to add a new node"

## âœ¨ **What We Delivered**

### **Visual PLUS Signs on Every Edge**
- **Always Visible**: Blue floating action buttons (FAB) with PLUS icons on every edge
- **Edit Mode Enhancement**: In Edit Mode, the PLUS buttons are larger (40px) and pulse with animation
- **View Mode**: Smaller PLUS buttons (32px) that appear on hover for cleaner view
- **Perfect Positioning**: Centered on each edge using React Flow's EdgeLabelRenderer

### **Smart Behavior**
- **Click to Add**: Click any PLUS button to instantly add a new Action node at that position
- **Automatic Reconnection**: Seamlessly breaks the existing edge and creates two new connections
- **Context Awareness**: Uses WorkflowEditContext to provide different behavior in edit vs view mode
- **Visual Feedback**: Hover effects, scaling animations, and color changes
